# paints_for_kids
### A fancy colorful application is an effective way to teach kids some computer skills.
### Educational games are another enjoyable way for kids teaching. In this project (Paint for Kids) we 
### are going to build a simple application that enables kids draw fancy shapes and also play some 
### simple games with those shapes. Your application should help a kid draw a number of figures, fill 
### them with different colors, save and load a graph, and so on. The application should provide a 
### game playing mode to teach kids how to differentiate between figuresâ€™ types and colors. 
## hello everyone this awesome project
